      "Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.\n",
      "About the role\n",
      "Anthropic is seeking an Event Designer to lead our brand presence through physical and digital experiences. You’ll drive the creative direction for our B2B events portfolio focused on field marketing and sales.\n",
      "You'll partner closely with the brand team and the Head of Events to transform our business and product objectives into memorable experiences. Your combination of strategic thinking, creative direction, and hands-on design expertise will be crucial in crafting creative narratives that resonate with diverse audiences.\n",
      "Responsibilities:\n",
      "\n",
      "Lead creative strategy and execution for our full events portfolio, ensuring cohesive experiences across industry conferences, hosted events, and executive experiences.\n",
      "Build flexible design systems that maintain brand integrity while adapting to different contexts and event sizes\n",
      "Transform technical concepts into compelling narratives through environmental design, presentations, and interactive elements that engage our audiences\n",
      "Direct and collaborate with agencies and vendors to scale programs effectively\n",
      "Work cross-functionally to align creative execution with our business strategy and core messaging\n",
      "\n",
      "You may be a good fit if you:\n",
      "\n",
      "Demonstrate extensive experience designing end-to-end B2B event experiences, encompassing presentation design, content marketing, physical build-outs, and digital touchpoints including websites, promotional materials, and email campaigns.\n",
      "Thrive in a role that combines high-level strategic planning with daily hands-on design execution, comfortable moving between big-picture thinking and tactical design work\n",
      "Build effective partnerships across teams, working well with executives, marketing, and product stakeholders\n",
      "Excel at making complex technical topics clear and engaging\n",
      "Balance high design standards with practical constraints, making thoughtful tradeoffs while maintaining quality in fast-paced environments\n",
      "Have previous in-house experience at a technology company (preferred)\n",
      "\n",
      "Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. \n",
      "The expected salary range for this position is:Annual Salary:$260,000—$305,000 USD\n",
      "Logistics\n",
      "Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.\n",
      "Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.\n",
      "We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.\n",
      "How we're different\n",
      "We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.\n",
      "The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.\n",
      "Come work with us!\n",
      "Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.\n",
